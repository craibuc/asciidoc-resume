a|* Developed a high-level, long-term migration plan to move from an internally-developed Business Intelligence portal to Business Objects Enterprise XI.  In the short run, he created a transparent, simplified interface between the portal and BOE XI.
* Designed and developed an application to collect and analyze product usage for their textile division.  This architecture reduced the complexity of data collection, increased quality and simplified the business process.
* Developed a row-level-security prototype using Crystal Reports XI and the BusinessObjects Universe.  This prototype includes both data security and parameter security.  This was especially challenging as the Universe’s integration with Crystal Reports XI was limited.
* Prototyped a report-localization architecture for their international reports.  This strategy used a less-known feature of Crystal Reports to dynamically alter labels depending on a workstation’s localization settings.  This architecture works for both scheduled and ‘on-demand’ reports.
* Created numerous Crystal Reports based on SAP’s BW.
* Created prototype reports using Business Objects’ OLAP Intelligence (OLAPi) based on SAP’s BW Analytical Services.
* Improved Ecolab’s SAP BW integration with Business Objects Enterprise XI using OLAP Intelligence.
* Developed a reusable, JavaScript application to simply the coding necessary to generate a Business Objects logon token that is created by an internally-developed, and wholly undocumented, BOE XI authentication webservice.
* Developed solutions to address the limitation of Crystal Reports’ integration with Business Objects’ Universe, specifically with dynamic-cascading-parameters.
